Wasn’t planning on writing anything today, or this week — I just didn’t feel the need to.

Last week, was planning on writing something, inspired by something my friend said, about how things change, and how things always change, and how I found myself, each time, coming to the same conclusion: things need to change. 

I wrote this line after, for the first time, I doubted that conclusion: "But watching as the weeks slip by, and friends come and go, I can’t help but miss when I felt truly loved, and I wonder whether I should have tried harder to stay, rather than leave.”

But that passed too. 

At the end of the week, facing the future, facing forward, I’ve realized it’s probably not the time anymore to write. 

I started writing because I felt the urge; I was at the end of something, and I wanted to understand what had happened.

Now, I feel most of what I’ve wanted to say has been said. It's not the time anymore for introspection; it feels like the time for experience. 

Or maybe I’m just lazy, overwhelmed with what I know I’ll have to do, and I’m preemptively reducing my workload, so I can have time to pause, breathe.

Either way, I think I’ll take a break for a while longer. Maybe forever, maybe not. 

I’ll let people know if I start writing again.
