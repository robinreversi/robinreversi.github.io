In my generation, it seems we’ve fixated on happiness.

Plain and simple, everyone I know wants to be happy, and most would choose that over money, love, looks — anything. Poor and happy is fine. Single and happy is fine. Ugly and happy is fine. But anything and unhappy is not fine. Few people, for whatever else it would get them, would willingly be absolutely miserable. For most, happiness is a necessary ingredient in their definition of a good life. 

And yet, in the private conversations I’ve had with friends and from what I’ve seen around me, it seems we struggle quite a bit with being happy. 

It may be a product of Stanford. In an environment in which overwork is not only common but encouraged, competency is put to the test daily, and seizing opportunity seems more important than making friends, being happy is hard. It’s much easier to be plagued with doubts, saddled with stress, and to be anxious, so very anxious, about the future. 

But I think there’s reasons to believe a systemic problem exists beyond Stanford’s campus. Or rather, that the problems that exist on Stanford’s campus are just symptoms of an incredibly broken culture. As Anne Helen Petersen puts it in ["How Millennials Became The Burnout Generation"](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/annehelenpetersen/millennials-burnout-generation-debt-work), we don’t try to break the system because that’s not how we’re raised. We try to win it. My generation’s first instinct isn’t to question the circumstances, to ask whether something is reasonable. Our first instinct isn't to try and push back against the problem, to stand our ground and say this is too much. Our first instinct is to put our heads down and work. We’ve become the ultimate yes-people, the ultimate optimizers, and it shows.

If I apply for a PhD program, I’m not going to contest the system and argue it’s exploitative; I’m going to do what it takes to get in. If I join Amazon full-time, I’m not going to protest and fight back against their unreasonable firing practices; I’m going to work so I’m never considered for expulsion. If I apply for an internship, and they drag me through eight rounds of interviews, I’m not going to quit and say this is bullshit; I’m going to stay in.

And though the particulars may differ, I know I’m not alone in any of this.

So when we’re told that we should try to be happy, that happiness is a goal worth achieving, that happiness, oddly enough, will make us happy, we rarely take the time to think through what’s really being said. We don’t take the time to really think through what’s meant by happiness, whether it even makes sense to try to be happy, whether we really should be happy, and even when we do stop to consider the assumptions, we rarely come to any solid conclusions. 

Who has a good definition for happiness? Who has a good way to measure happiness? 

Instead, we blindly try and optimize without any specific goal in mind except for a vague, ever-present sense of inadequacy hanging over us, the feeling that you’re just not happy enough, that you could be happier. Thus, finding happiness becomes, at best, another burden, another task, another chore, another checkbox to mark off, like eating healthy or working out. At worst, finding happiness becomes a false promise, a wild goose chase, a mythical dream that exists only in Walt Disney films, the happily-ever-after ending that says good enough is not okay, that you should not be decently happy, that you have to be wildly happy. At worst, we start to feel unhappy about our lack of happiness. 

It is exactly as David Foster Wallace [says](https://fs.blog/2012/04/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/):

"This, I submit, is the freedom of a real education, of learning how to be well-adjusted. You get to consciously decide what has meaning and what doesn’t. You get to decide what to worship.

Because here’s something else that’s weird but true: in the day-to-day trenches of adult life, there is actually no such thing as atheism. There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship. And the compelling reason for maybe choosing some sort of god or spiritual-type thing to worship–be it JC or Allah, be it YHWH or the Wiccan Mother Goddess, or the Four Noble Truths, or some inviolable set of ethical principles–is that pretty much anything else you worship will eat you alive.”

Value anything too much, in other words, and you’ll always be left wanting. 

Worship money, and you’ll always feel poor.

Worship beauty, and you’ll always feel ugly.

Worship power, and you’ll always feel insecure.

Worship intellect, and you’ll always feel stupid.

Worship happiness, and you’ll always feel less than happy. 

At this point, let me be clear. This is not a tirade against wanting to be happy. Actually, over all the other things that I’ve listed — money, beauty, power, intellect — I think happiness is a fantastic goal, a huge improvement over what people prioritized in the past. 

But it’s clear our understanding is wanting and our approach is broken. 

So here’s my attempt at trying to understand what it means to be happy. 

As is often useful when trying to define anything, it’s helpful to consider the extremes, and in the case of happiness, suicidal depression seems to be a clear extreme, a clear demarcation of what it means to be very, very unhappy. 

What we need to understand, though, is why. Why is it that committing suicide is so obviously something that only an extremely unhappy person would do? Why doesn’t, in other words, a happy person commit suicide from time to time?

Phrased in that way, the answer is simple. A happy person doesn’t commit suicide because in their view, life is better than death. An extremely unhappy person commits suicide because life is unbearable; life is worse than death. The happy person is happy to be alive. The suicidal person is not. 

And therein lies what I see as a better definition for happiness — how happy you are to be alive.

It’s better because it’s more specific. We’re rating the experience of being alive and how much better or worse it is compared to not existing. 

It’s better because the range of emotions is more clearly defined and yet still quite nuanced. You have strongly preferring death on one end, and strongly preferring life on the other, and anything in between.

It’s better because, in my mind, I usually get a singular answer. When someone asks me whether I’m happy, I have no idea what to say. There are just too many ways of answering the question. But if someone were to ask me if I’m happy to be alive, I’d be able to give a number, point to a spot on a line, position myself quickly. 

It’s, in other words, a much more useful definition, and I think it’s a truthful one too. 

When I think about the happiest I’ve been, it’s when I’ve felt quite happy to be alive. When I think about the unhappiest I’ve been, it’s when I’ve wished I could be dead. 

The question then is what this implies about how we should live, if anything, and I’ll address that next week. 

# Other Thoughts and Reflection

Well, late again. 

I started earlier this time, picking ideas Tuesday, drafting things out Wednesday, but I lost momentum by Thursday, and I crowded everything again into Sunday. 

I think I’m going to change this to a 3pm release. 

More serious thoughts, this piece changed a lot from what I originally intended.

I didn’t plan to spend so much time justifying or motivating the problem, but it felt like I had to once I started writing. It felt understanding the problem itself was worth its own blog post, and I wonder whether I made a convincing argument in the end anyways. One of the nice things about writing is that you’re forced to question how much of your own emotions and feelings you project onto others. I don’t really know if this is how a lot of people feel. I used “we” a lot, but it could really just be me and a few other friends.

I’m also quite happy with this piece though. I think it’s an interesting idea, and I think for once it’s a little bit original. I hope the idea of measuring your happiness by comparing it to not being alive is, if sobering, at least interesting. It was weird to think of life as a service, as something you could rate, and to interpret happiness in that way.

I think next week’s piece will be even more interesting though. There’s a lot of interesting things about the way we act and what we do that I think you can explain if you look at happiness a little more closely.
