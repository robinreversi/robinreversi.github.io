I gave a Subway worker a twenty dollar tip once.

He looked at me with so much gratitude. 

That felt good.

It didn’t feel good, just minutes before, to buy a sandwich for the homeless man outside who told me: “I don’t need food. I need money. You got any money?”

How dare he?

I was quite angry. 

How dare he?

But you look, and you realize he’s got bread and cakes from Paris Baguette. He had sandwiches from Subway, pizza boxes from Pizza My Heart. He had bags all around him, donations of food, so much food.

He didn’t need food. 

He needed money.

— 

Once upon a time, walking around with a date at night, bellies still full from dinner, we turn a corner and find yet another homeless man. 

He asks us for money, and we try and walk past, stiff, face tightening, jaw clenching. 

He pleads. We walk faster. 

And he screams, in frustration:

“YOU WON’T EVEN LOOK AT ME?”

A few blocks up from the Orpheum Theatre where Hamilton is showing, a hundred dollars a seat, a man is sitting, back against a power box.

He has a cardboard sign that says

Anything Helps
God Bless

in thick, black Sharpie. 

His eyes are clear and blue, and his smile is childlike — innocent, gentle, friendly, frail.

He asks for change, and I say no, sorry the way I’ve always been taught to say sorry to these people — apologetically, but also soullessly, tonelessly, with only the briefest flicker of empathy, just enough to make me feel good about myself, to assure myself that I am no monster, that I can sympathize with the poor. 

And so I’m ashamed and surprised when he wishes me a good weekend. Because, unlike me, I can tell he means it.

A man runs out into the streets, pointing something black at incoming traffic.

Cars screech swerve and then speed up again, and drivers scream at the man as they realize he’s not holding a gun. 

He’s pointing his wallet, and laughing. 

— 

On a corner in SF, there’s a group of homeless people. 

Some of them are shirtless.

Most have no shoes.

One of them is only wearing a blanket. 

An old man in a wheelchair crosses the streets, dark shades on, boombox or speaker strapped to the back, and he’s blasting music from the 70s. 

Old classic funk — or maybe rock, I can’t remember.

And you see him, slamming his head up and down, practically leaping out of his wheelchair.

He’s dancing.

He’s dancing, and almost as a challenge to the group of homeless men, he pushes in, and dances more aggressively, his wheelchair shaking now as he comes out and back into it. 

They ignore him at first, but pretty soon, one person starts grooving, and then another, and then another. 

Pretty soon, there’s four or five homeless men dancing to music from the 70s in a random corner in SF.

From the bus rides, late at night, you can see people falling asleep in the streets of Seattle.

The lucky ones have a cardboard bed, maybe a dirty baby blanket with cars and trucks stitched in, and a shopping cart or a suitcase if they have things to protect.

The unlucky ones sleep on the staircases of derelict buildings, propped up against a wall, wrapped in rags that are too thin for the night and too hot for the day. 

Either way, it seems they’re used to sleeping on the streets. Even when you walk past, there’s barely a stir.

—

Every morning, on the way to work, I see the same people begging, and the first thing they ask for isn’t money. 

It’s a cigarette.

“Do you have a cigarette?”

Their skin is so pale, their legs are so thin, and their face is so bony it looks like a yawn would cut their cheeks. 

— 

Outside the bookstore, I scramble to open my wallet.

How much is too little?

How much is too much?

I pull out a dollar.

Shame floods in.

What can he do with a dollar?

How insulting.

Should I pull out more?

I don’t know, that’d be kind of awkward. 

Meanwhile, I’ve already given him the dollar, and I’m waiting there, in that half-second, to hear his response. 

He looks at me, at the dollar, and then back at me. 

I stiffen, half-expecting a rebuke, but instead he clasps my hand between his, large and textured like cracked leather, and he bows his head and tells me: 

“Shi shi.”

# Reflection 

I really had high hopes for this piece, but I blew it. I didn’t prepare. I didn’t write. I didn’t force myself to stay on schedule.

Ultimately, very dissatisfying.

I intended for this piece to be a reflection on the times where I personally have seen or interacted with the homeless because the homeless are the ones that have probably most directly impacted what I want to do with my life. 

I intended for the stories to be more impactful, especially the one “YOU WON’T EVEN  LOOK AT ME” one. 

I intended for there to be some interesting depiction of homeless life, of how it’s hard to categorize these people because they’re fundamentally people, and thus all very different. 

I intended for the writing to be sparse on details, to lack distinctions, to illustrate the point that these events are things that happen just in passing for me, and I can afford to remember them poorly, as most people do.

I intended to make an analogy about high rise buildings, and how when you're at the top, you only see things like lake, sky, and other high rises, but you completely fail to see people unless you make the effort to squint and look down. 

Instead, I got a string of stories, light on detail, lighter on content, and a very mediocre conclusion, with way too much of me in it, and no clear sense of direction. 

Gah.

Extremely frustrating because I can see how I can make this better, but I didn’t. 

Otherwise, thanks for reading, hope there was at least something interesting.
