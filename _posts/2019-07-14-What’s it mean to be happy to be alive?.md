Last time I tried to introduce happiness as how happy you feel to be alive.

But I didn’t do much to explain or defend the idea aside from a single example. 

Naturally, there are some questions. 

**Q: Isn’t this a circular definition? What do you mean by “happy to be alive?” How is that different from being just “happy"?**

Imagine you were sold an experience, and you were asked how happy you were with the experience.

Living is just that, an experience, and how happy you are with that experience is what I think we mean by “happiness". 

Are you bored by the current experience?

Do you feel unsatisfied?

Do you feel like there’s a point to this experience? 

Do you want to leave this experience early?

Replace “experience” with “life,” and I think agreeing with any of these is a clear sign you haven’t quite “found happiness.” 

Likewise:

Do you feel this experience is worthwhile?

Do you feel happy to have had this experience? 

Do you feel engaged in this experience?

Do you feel happy this experience will go on for longer?

I think agreeing with any of these is an indication you've “found happiness” in some shape or form.

Thus, it seems clear to me that there is some relationship between “happiness” and how you would rate being alive. So when I say happiness is how happy you feel to be alive, another way to understand what I mean is: happiness is how you would rate the experience of being alive. 

This may seem obvious and frankly quite useless. Of course “happiness” is how you would rate the experience of being alive. What else could it be?

But ask yourself both whether you’re capital-H happy and how you would rate your experience of being alive and see which one is easier to answer. 

In one case, you have a vague abstract notion to deal with. In the other, it’s a simple question of: am I getting what I want out of life? 

**Q: Isn’t what you’re describing here just satisfaction? Why not just say “happiness is how satisfied you feel to be alive”?**

Let’s say you order a vacuum cleaner, and it arrives, and it’s way better than you expected. It leaves your floors spick and span, makes no noise, is easy to push, gets the corners, and is completely wireless, without any of the weak battery issues that usually come with wireless things. Not only that, but this vacuum cleaner is the cheapest on the market and not just relatively cheap. It’s really a good price, and it comes with a warranty, one you’ll probably never need because this thing seems built to last.

Is “satisfied” really the word you’d use to say how you feel? I know my grandma, if she ever found any kind of domestic appliance with this kind of quality, would be much that just satisfied. She’d be ecstatic, giggling, laughing with joy. 

Pedantic analogies aside, I don’t say “happiness is how satisfied you feel to be alive” because I think you can be much more than satisfied with a product or a service. You can be ecstatic, joyful, deeply pleased, delighted, grateful even. 

I’m not sure if “happy" is the right word to describe all these things either, but at least “happy” allows for intensity. You can be intensely, deeply happy, and you can be intensely, deeply happy with how your life is going. 

You might say you can be intensely, deeply satisfied, but the connotation there, to me, feels too subdued.

**Q: If you’re not happy to be alive, that seems to suggest you’d prefer to be dead, but that’s not always true. Isn’t that an issue?**

You can be absolutely miserable, completely unhappy to be alive, and yet still want to live. There are five cases I can think of.

The first is simple and probably the most commonplace. If you believe life will improve, that you will be happy to be alive in the future despite how you feel now, it makes sense to continue living. You’re expecting a reward, why quit now? We even have a term for it — living for the weekends. 

The second is rare. One might choose to live despite being absolutely miserable if they have a cause they believe in. The author of “Evicted,” a book on how evictions are actually a source of poverty not just a symptom, lived with the poorest people in Milwaukee and reported feeling overwhelming depressed at times in the epilogue of his book. Revolutionaries everywhere who believe in liberty or death live through heatstroke, malnutrition, poverty, disease, fear, anxiety, stress. You’ll stay alive even if you’re miserable if there’s a cause you feel you need to see done.

The third is love. There are more than a few stories of parents living through atrocious circumstances to support their children. I think of my mom who worked from six in the morning to two in the morning, every day, taking care of home, kitchen, kids for years, and how miserable she was through a lot of this, but how she did it all anyway. I think of my dad who could have left for Korea after he divorced my mom, dodging the multi-million dollar debt of his failing company, but instead chose to stay here, bills hanging like an axe over his head, just so he could stay near his kids. It’d make more sense if they chose to abandon their kids and fend for themselves. But it’s clear that love can win out over self-preservation. 

The fourth is religion, faith, belief. Some religions prohibit suicide, and if you seriously believe in concepts like heaven and hell, it makes sense you’d choose a finite amount of suffering over an infinite amount. I don’t have much experience with religion, so I can’t say definitively, but I can imagine its influence.

The fifth is jarring and personal. Fear of pain. I think this is one you need to have been there to understand. The fear of pain is probably what kept me from going off the deep end. At some points in my life, if I could have blinked out of existence peacefully, without any pain, I might have. Perhaps there’s room for the biological argument here. Naturally, we oppose our own deaths. Maybe you really have to be pushed beyond total misery in order to pull that trigger. 

There are many reasons, in other words, why we choose to live beyond just happiness. How happy we are to be alive is not the only thing that determines whether we want to live. 

**Q: Alright, so what’s this imply about how we should live?**

First, consider another obvious revelation: life is not a product that is sold to you, complete and packaged and boxed away. It’s one that we actively take part in constructing. We are both the consumers and the producers of our lives. 

If that’s true, and happiness is how happy you feel to be alive, then it’s clear that finding happiness means finding a life that would make you happy to be alive and moving towards it. We find happiness, in other words, when we reach the kind of life that we would rate highly. And so it also becomes clear that finding happiness requires two things, a deep understanding of the self and a pragmatic understanding of the world. 

Do you prefer lots of leisure or lots of work? What needs to happen in order to lighten the workload?

Do you prefer friends or isolation? What needs to happen in order to make more friends?

Do you need a sense of purpose or are you fine living day-to-day, simply? What needs to happen in order to accomplish your long-term goals?

The questions go on and on.

Furthermore, it becomes clear that if you don’t know what you want, or if you want is unattainable, you will never be able to find happiness. You might already have it, but you will have no clue how to find it again when circumstances change. You’ll stumble around until the circumstances you didn’t know you preferred return again. And this I think is another interesting point — you can be happy without understanding anything about how to find it. 

There are other implications as well. For instance, there are no “truer” or more “meaningful” sources of happiness. It’s just personal preference. A warm patch of sun, a cold beer, making millions, seeing friends, writing, running, crying, whatever. Whatever makes you feel happy to be alive. Some, maybe, are more sustainable sources than others, but fundamentally, all the same. So don’t feel silly about being happy at weird things. 

Another implication — if you’re not happy already, happiness is something you'll need to work towards and probably for a long time. It takes time to understand the self, and it takes time to understand how the world functions, how to get what you want, if you can get what you want. These are what determine the constraints of where and when you can be happy, and figuring out those boundaries is a life long process that you can only really speed up by being introspective, open to new experiences, and hard-working.

Another implication — the more you demand out of life, the more you will need to work. For instance, if you want a life in which everyday is spectacular, you will need to work quite hard to find something so interesting everyday. This isn’t the same as saying lower your standards. Personally, I couldn’t — it’d make me too unhappy. What it is saying is this: if lowering your standards doesn’t make you unhappy, lower your standards. If you can be happy with less, if a simple life can make you happy, and happiness is what you want, just live the simple life. It’s a lot less work. 

Another implication — it is incredibly useless to just say you want a happy life. If you find happiness when you reach a life you would rate highly, then saying you want a happy life is saying you want a life you would rate highly. You’ve made no progress in understanding what that life is. Figure out the specifics because that’s what provides a direction and a goal. 

I’m sure there are other extensions too and even more questions to address. But I’m going to stop here. 

# Stray Thoughts and Reflection

I may just be extremely tired and sleep-deprived, but for once I felt like I nailed it, like I said what I wanted to say and addressed the problems I wanted to address. I think the definition I have for happiness feels true, or at least somewhat right, and I’m happy with it. The only bit I didn’t get to fit in was the idea that you can view life as something to be consumed or as a tool with which you can affect the world. In other words, I think you can look at life as both a means to an end or an end onto itself, and I think there’s a lot of interesting ideas with that, especially in relation to happiness and measuring your life. 

The question-answer format helped a lot with writing because that’s how I think, but I don’t want to rely on this as a crutch. Would also be interested in knowing whether people thought this was entertaining, effective, distracting, not good, etc.

A lot of the motivation for this piece came from thinking about the cashiers I saw at Target growing up. A lot of them looked so dead-eyed, like they didn’t want to be there, like living was such a pain, and I didn’t understand why I felt just as bad for them, in some ways, as I did for the many people I knew to be homeless in the streets. It took a long time to articulate, but I do think what I’ve suggested is right. A lot of people would not give living a great review. A lot of people were not happy to be alive. 

I think it’s also interesting that this piece, though derived from my emotions and my experiences, was so oddly impersonal. There were no stories throughout all this, and I worry that it was too pedantic. 

There was one point though in which I mentioned some of the suicidal thoughts I’d had. I want to be clear — I’m very okay now. And while there was a point in my life where I did think about it a lot, I don’t know if I ever came close. The biological urge to stay alive is really, really strong. Thinking about dying often felt like a kick to my stomach, somehow worse than everything I was going through. It made me feel wild, like every nerve was screaming not to do it. But I’ll write about this sometime in another post.

It’s also interesting to me that my mom has been giving me similar advice recently — pick a lifestyle you want. My beliefs were probably influenced, but I think I raised this definition without that advice in mind, so it’s interesting (and probably a good sign) that I reached the same conclusion. 

I’d also like to write a disclaimer here. This was written from an extremely privileged, comfortably upper-middle class view. I can’t say what finding happiness looks like when you don’t have food, shelter, friends, family, stability, job security. I imagine some parts are the same — defining a life you want and working towards it — but there are likely many, many parts that are not. This is a guide, in other words, for how people who have all the means to be happy to learn how to be happy and what happiness means.

I also wanted to point out one question I couldn’t address yet, but that is concerning, and it’s a classic question: if you could take a drug that made you feel happy to be alive everyday, would you? I had some stuff written, but it didn’t feel quite right, so I decided not to address this for now. I think circumstances matter a lot for this question. 

I also find it ironic that the week I gave up on submitting on time, but I was closer to being on time than all my other posts so far. 

Thank you for reading!
