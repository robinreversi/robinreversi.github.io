This post marks the thirteen post I’ll have made, which means it’s been exactly a quarter of a year since I started writing. I wanted to make a special recap post every thirteen weeks documenting what it’s been like to write this blog.

I thought about starting this recap post by revisiting why I started writing, but the more I tried, the more I realized I already said everything I needed to in the Intro post. I found myself quoting lines rather than adding substance, and I think, having read a bit more about the chronology of my life now, the Intro, ironically, will make a lot more sense, especially why I started writing. 

So instead, I’ll start with what it’s been like to write every week for the last twelve weeks, and here, it’s what you’d expect. 

It’s been hard. 

With the exception of maybe one or two pieces, every week has been a struggle, a mad, five, six, seven hour sprint to completion on Saturday or Sunday, sweating bullets because I can’t make my deadline, because I'm worried about the quality, the truthfulness.

There were attempts to make plans, to schedule out time on weekdays and make steady progress, but a nine-to-five job, I learned, is more exhausting than school, especially when bus rides leach an hour off the ends of each day, leaving you with maybe two or three hours to relax before you need to climb back into bed and do it all again the next day. 

That's probably one reason people become less interesting as they grow older; it gets harder to find the time and energy to have interest in the things life can offer. Your world contracts. 

I did eventually settle though: pick a topic by Tuesday, start writing something by Thursday, and finish Saturday and Sunday, and that’s how I’ve been scraping by. But it’s been hard, and I’ve thought more than once about quitting or switching to a biweekly format.

And it’s been hard to write every week not only because of the stress of writing, of meeting arbitrary deadlines probably only I really care about, but also because I’ve had to give up opportunity. 

I don’t feel happy whenever I choose to go back early on a Saturday night or ditch Sunday brunch to work on my writing.

I don’t feel great when I see a series of lecture videos I’ve been meaning to watch, unplayed, but I know I have to write. 

I feel quite stressed when I know I should be preparing for interviews, or updating my resume, or working on an upcoming project, but I also know there’s so much work to be done with this blog post.

I know had I not chosen to do this stupidly long, difficult project, I would have had a much more enjoyable summer, one where I could have worked on longer term goals, made more enjoyable memories, and, in general, stressed less.

Pragmatically, emotionally, this was probably a stupid decision. At the very least, I should not have chained myself to a weekly schedule. I overestimated the durability of my enthusiasm and underestimated the sacrifices I’d need to make.

I feel burnt out.

For that reason, I’m going to take a break from publishing for three weeks. I need time to recover, to pursue other interests, to tend to relationships, to allow other parts of my life to breathe. 

I know this breaks what I originally set out to do — fifty-two posts in fifty-two weeks — but whatever, honestly. It’s not realistic, and the costs, clearly, are too heavy.

It’s clear to me, even now, as I’m writing, that my attention is drifting to all the things I could be doing. 

Expect a post, however, on the benefits of writing a blog sometime in the future because they do exist. I just can’t write them now because I’m not feeling it, and if there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that I’m really, really stubborn about not faking things. 

I hate that so much. 

Before I go though, I just wanted to thank you all for reading my blog until now. One of the benefits I will say about keeping a blog is that you realize how many people are actually willing to sacrifice a portion of their time to get to know you better, to read what you’re thinking. In this day and age when people are so incredibly busy, I’m grateful, deeply grateful, that I have people in my life like that. 

I also wanted to thank a few other people for inspiring me to write in the first place.

- Sam Kwong, probably the biggest inspiration with his Hundred Days of Reflection which sparked both my interest and my competitive instinct
- Chip Huyen, whose Learn 365 blog was the first student blog I ever read and convinced me someone my age could write something worth reading 
- Andrew Huang, who boldly published his blog to Facebook and showed me that people would read your stuff if you sent it
- Rachel Cheong, my sister, who probably kept me from becoming a savant like robot, instead teaching me to appreciate nuance and writing and emotion

All in all, I would give myself a B+. There were many, many things I could have done better, but it was a solid effort, with more than a few pieces where I felt like I captured what I wanted to say — Making Small Talk Interesting, Fencing, The End of an Era, What’s it mean to be happy to be alive? — and many more I learned a lot from writing, even if not the best.

I fully intend to keep writing, although whether it’s at a weekly pace in the future or a slower pace is still undecided. 

Thanks again!
