I hated my mom for a long while because she demanded so much from me, more, it seemed, than anyone else’s parent.

“This is San Antonio. This is Texas. This is the United States.”

“If you don’t get an A, you just aren't working hard enough."

“You’re lucky you weren’t born in Korea.”

Why couldn’t I just be a normal kid?

Why couldn’t I be like everyone else whose parents were happy when their kid got an A, whose parents would buy them fruit gushers and pack them snacks, whose parents actually attended their field trips or took them to the zoo, the aquarium, outside?

I said last time manga made me see the world differently, made me believe again that wind could be more than just the movement of air.

That was true. Believing life could be better, that I could be someone radiant, cheerful, hopeful, despite the bullying, the isolation, the indifference — that kept me from tipping over the edge.

But you need reasons to be hopeful; blind hope is faith, and I had seen too much, felt too much, come too close to have any of that.

I had to have a reason to believe in a better future, and in eighth grade, I got two. My sister got into Harvard, and my mom brought up the prospect of going to private school, conditional on me getting a full ride scholarship, to allow for more fencing. 

Both, really, had the same message — study hard, train hard, and you can escape hell. 

It was a message that had been passed down generation to generation, from my grandma to my mom and then my mom to me.

I didn’t get the scholarship, but my mom decided to pay anyway.

To this day, I don’t know why she paid, whether she paid because I was suffering or because fencing was my best shot into a good college. 

Maybe both, I don’t know, but it didn’t matter. I had escaped public school, and private school seemed a comparative oasis. 

I can’t tell you what it was like to have a good lunch for once, to be able to walk into a restroom and not have to clean the toilet before using it, to be able to work in a quiet classroom enclosed by trees. 

Such small things, but it felt like I had been given too much, and I worked hard to return the debt I owed my mom.

The standards rose again. Saint Mary’s Hall graded on a plus-minus system, meaning an A wasn’t enough anymore. Everything had to be an A+, a 96.5 or above. 

Fencing got harder. I started to compete more, started to rise higher, and eventually I was missing school every two weeks to travel. 

And soon, all I was doing was studying or fencing. 

Wake up at six, morning classes, work at lunch, evening classes, work until fencing, fence until nine, get back at ten, work until I finished everything for the next day. 

I wish I could tell you something interesting that happened to me in school between freshman and junior year, but I can’t. I wish that I could tell you I made friends, that I had people I could rely on, but I didn’t. I wish I could tell you that finally, now that the environment wasn’t hostile anymore, I could be myself, but I couldn't. 

Instead, I was stuck in what my sister and I call survival mode, a state of mind in which you’re constantly on the lookout for new threats, a perpetual feeling of fight or flight, of insecurity and danger. I wasn't looking to make friends; I was looking to avoid enemies, antagonists, foes, and bullies. I was looking to survive, even when no one was trying to hurt me.

# Thoughts and Reflections

I thought I hit a low when I wrote How to be Judgmental, but frankly, I really did not want to publish this one.

Maybe it’s because I’ve written too many emotionally draining things lately, too many personal stories, but I’ve become really sick and tired of hearing my own voice. The way I talk about my experiences has started to feel cliche and repetitive to me.
 
This was a hard piece to write too. Not because the content was difficult but because I couldn’t remember accurately what had happened, what I felt. I couldn’t remember whether I felt numb or sad, whether I felt angry or tired, whether I felt happy ever — there were just so many questions, and no way to get the answer. So many times I’d start a sentence, but the whole thing would feel false, forced, and inauthentic, and I have a hard time writing anything I don’t believe. And frankly it’s shocking to me I can’t remember the details of some fairly traumatic things in my life. And even when I did have the details, I lacked the skill to include them elegantly, to weave them into the story. 

Maybe I took on too large of a project. Describing my childhood experiences with bullying and depression in two or three pieces is probably too ambitious. Or maybe more likely, I’m not allotting enough time.

I don’t know. I’m frustrated and angry right now.

Part 3 will probably come later and will wrap up this unexpected saga, but for now I need to take a break from writing serious things — expect something light-hearted next week.

I do want to clarify one thing though. I think my mom comes off as a tyrant in these pieces, and while she was a very tough mother for a long time, her story is much more complicated and nuanced than what my writing is suggesting right now. I plan to describe my relationship with her growing up someday, but please believe me when I say she’s a fantastic mom, and one of the biggest reasons I survived middle school.

Thanks for reading.
