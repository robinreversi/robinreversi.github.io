title: How To Be Judgmental

As someone who is frequently criticized as being too judgmental, I think a lot about whether I have the right to judge anyone, and I thought it’d be interesting to write this piece.

To start, what does it mean for someone to be judgmental? I’d call someone judgmental if they’re willing to make claims about who another person is based on what they’ve observed of that person. In other words, if you say you’re a nice person, and I think you’re mean, I think that counts as being judgmental. If you say you’re a nice person, and internally I agree, that still counts as being judgmental. If however, you say you’re a nice person, and I take your own word for it, then I think that’s the opposite of being judgmental. 

In this sense, being judgmental reduces down to having private opinions about other people, and there it becomes completely obvious that yes, we do have the right to judge others, and moreover, it’s a completely natural thing to do. What then is the problem? 

Probably two-fold. The first is that judgmental people do not allow others to speak for themselves. Your own reasons, rationales, etc. might influence a judgmental person’s opinions about you, but ultimately how you're interpreted is their choice. And having little or no control over how you’re understood is probably one of the most tragic things that can happen to a person. Imagine living with someone who interpreted everything you did in the worst possible way, blaming and criticizing you, assuming, at every step, the worst from you. It seems unbearable, and I sympathize with anyone who has a relationship with someone like this.

The second issue is in how judgmental people come to their opinions. Take for instance, an overworked, single parent of three, struggling to pay the bills despite working from six A.M to two A.M. Maybe you run into them at the local grocery store and witness them snap and yell at their kids. It’d be easy to come to the conclusion that they’re a terrible parent, that they don’t care about their children, but obviously we lack the full story. Fill in the sad details as you please, but it’s clear that any judgment we render here will be a shallow one.

There might be more issues, but I see these as the most fundamental. By having private opinions about a person, we, in some sense, take away their power to self-represent, to say who they are. By lacking information, it’s more than plausible that these opinions are flawed, biased, and hurtful. 

Given these issues, is there any defensible way in which we can come to have judgments about other people? 

The first problem is easy enough to solve — take into consideration what people have to say about themselves and be generous. Not to say that you always need to agree; I don’t think who we are should be decided only by ourselves. I know a person who has not treated me well, and had I had the courage to accept my view of who they were over theirs sooner, I don’t think I would have suffered as much. But at least give people the chance to speak for themselves.

The second problem is trickier because it’s true that we never have access to the full story. We never really know all of the circumstances behind the events that we see, and it’s usually at this point we hear “well since you don’t know what’s going on, it’s best not to assume anything.” 

That’s certainly one option, but, frankly, I don’t think it’s a reasonable one. Being judgmental, having private opinions of people, is not only a natural behavior but also a beneficial one. Namely, having your own opinions of people keeps you wary of those who might use or hurt you and also shields you against the opinions of those you find unreasonable or disagreeable. Admittedly, you might be wrong sometimes and hurt people you don’t intend too. But self-induced blindness is certainly not a viable policy.

What then is a policy we can follow with a limited amount of information?

I think, in most cases, we can fairly judge who a person is and what they want by looking at their actions over a long period of time. If someone says they’re diligent, studious, and hard-working, see how they spend their time. If someone says they’re confident, independent, or kind, see how they act around others. If someone says they want to be your friend, see if they’re willing to put time aside for you. If someone says they want to a relationship, see if they go out looking for dates.

As my mom has told me for years, action talks.

And this policy has generally worked well for me for most of my life. I feel like I’ve been able to distinguish the people who care about me from the ones that don’t. I feel like I’ve able to tell what people really care about and what they only say they care about. And I feel like I’ve gotten to know some people better than they know themselves. 

Like any policy that deals with imperfect information, however, this one is also flawed in some sense. Take for instance, the overworked, single parent of three. It’d be cruel to say they don’t care about their kids because they fail to spend any time with them although that’s what we might infer based on their actions. Or in a more mundane example, friends who frequently cancel lunches and dinners might genuinely be busy, struggling to stay afloat with the work or family issues they have. It might not be that you’re not friends; they really just might be that busy. 

At the same time, the predictions really do seem to work in the long run. Let’s say on their days off, the overworked, single parent of three chooses to rejuvenate, leaving their children in the hands of a babysitter, perhaps choosing to go to the bar, or to a massage, or wherever. This is their routine whenever they get a break. In contrast, let’s say another overworked, single parent of three chooses to spend time with their children, heading to a park, or the movies, or wherever. 

Is it unfair to say one parent cares more for their children than the other? 

Or let’s say one friend regularly cancels lunches, and another makes it to every one. You don’t know how busy they really are, and it’s entirely possible one is much busier than the other. But maybe this happens for months. 

Is it unfair to say one friend cares more or values your company more than the other? 

I don’t know. Frankly, I expect responses to these questions to be pretty divided. At the same time, however, I do know that if I had to guess which parent would stick around with their kids, or which friend would come and get lunch with me, my predictions would be pretty simple, and in that sense I feel like this policy gets something right without being overly or unfairly strict. 

Of course, I’m open to other ideas — I’m still searching for ways I can come to more accurate opinions about other people. And I’m still not totally sure whether this is okay to do. I may have made the downsides of judging others seem trivial; they are not. It’s one thing to write abstractly about taking away someone’s right to self-represent. It’s another thing to have told someone they are not who they think they are, to put their own identity under the intense spotlight of scrutiny. And to the many people I’ve hurt as a result of being too quick to assume, I’m deeply sorry. 

Still, I believe being judgmental is necessary and not just because it offers protection. In some senses, I think forming judgments about other people is exactly how we become closer to them. There’s that moment of “ah, so that’s what this person is like” in which you know you’ve understood something more fundamental about another person. Without those moments, without being able to claim to know something about the people around me, I don’t know what closeness would be like.


# Reflection

Holy smokes.

This was a really, really hard piece to write. So many things to get right. So many ideas to express. And then during finals week? A one-two combo that has left me quite exhausted and behind on studying.

Still, I think I finally got my ideas down in a way that feels right and true, and I’m happy with that. Though, reading it over again, the whole subject feels boring and mundane, like everything I’ve said was completely obvious. I can’t tell whether that’s because it is or because I’ve been churning these ideas through my mind again and again, but either way, I feel the best part of writing these more analytical posts is that I can finally clarify what I’ve been thinking for a while, so I'm content with that.
