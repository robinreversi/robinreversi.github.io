The first day of middle school, I was something like a shy SpongeBob. I felt the way new feels for new people — intimidated but excited, fearful but daring, awkward but hopelessly enthusiastic. I remember being excited to be able to pick what I wanted to study, to have lockers and periods, to make new friends, to be a teenager.

The first class, the first day, we do icebreakers, the one where you introduce your partner to the class. I wait, stiff-shouldered, a bundle of excitement, anticipation, and apprehension, and when it’s our turn, I stand up and forget my partner's name. I turn, embarrassed, and ask “Sorry, what was your name again?” — and the whole class bursts into laughter. Shocked, I sat down. Or I didn’t. I don’t remember. I just remember the laughter. 

Middle school didn't improve much from that point. See, it wasn’t really just a one-off incident. Who knows why, but people in my middle school loved to grow closer through bullying. They loved ridiculing each other, not in the way close friends tend to, but in the way that deepens insecurities, drawing blood with every joke. Too unwilling to hurt for laughs and too easily hurt and laughed at, I didn’t ever find myself comfortable with anyone in my cohort. So I tried to be alone.

But even that was hard sometimes. I’d go out of my way to avoid people, but they’d find me, and the worst moments were when I would be teased and harassed by so-and-so or another, be made fun of for being Asian, or being nerdy, or whatever, and people would laugh, and I would be unable to respond, so overcome with emotion, fists tightening, tears welling, jaw locking, breathe trapped inside. I’d want to scream but I couldn’t. I’d want to fight but I couldn’t. 

Anger at my helplessness would keep me from falling asleep. I’d replay the scenario over and over again in my head at night, the humiliation still raw enough to bring heat to my face, and I’d think through what I could have said, what I could have done. 

Pretend I didn’t hear it

Laugh and brush it off

Flip them off

Condescendingly: “Your life is your punishment"

“At least my head doesn’t look like a penis.”

“Nice one, *racial slur*”

"You’re as dumb and fat as the shits you take”

I’d keep thinking until I found something that had lethal venom, that could guarantee that they’d never hurt me again, or at least make it so I came out on top. Usually only half-satisfied, I’d stash whatever I had away in the back of my mind until I saw them again. And when I did, I’d have a poison dart on the tip of my tongue, so eager and so, so ready for the slightest provocation.

Not to say I won every fight — I lost more than I won, simply because I was a more sensitive kid. But at the very least, I learned how to prepare for these confrontations and how to be venomous. I didn’t win every fight but at least I could fight back. 

And all that time lying awake at night taught me something more general too: if practice makes perfect, practicing in your head makes for a lot of practice, especially in the context of social skills.

Want to be funny? Think back to every time you weren’t and run through all the things you could have said.

Want to be charismatic? Think back to every time you weren’t and run through how you could have been or what the most charismatic people you know would have done.

Want to be smooth on a date, ace a job interview, or make someone feel better in a conversation? Simulate the whole thing, map out all the ways the conversation could go, and be prepared. 

I don’t know how many people believe I have the qualities and skills above, but I can say that whatever I do have comes from practicing in my head. 

As a result of middle school, I came out fairly traumatized, and I didn’t try to make friends for the next three years of high school. I trusted no one, and I sat alone at lunch between 6th and 11th grade. But due to some events, namely not making world championships, I decided to reach out again to see what was there. And learning to function socially again, to be normal-ish, would have been impossible without the time that I spent, ironically, inside my own head, running situations over and over again until I found ones with outcomes I liked.

# Stray Thoughts and Reflection 

In some ways I think this is incredibly obvious: how else do you get better unless you practice? But in some ways I think I’ve spent much more time practicing than other people and on things most people don’t think you can improve. I regret that the story is so dark, but my hope is that readers give practicing in their head a try even if they don’t necessarily completely trust me or come to the same conclusions.

I realize now that the social anxiety I had from middle school is still very present. It’s obvious to me that this is not a normal way to behave socially, and I still do map out casual conversations sometimes. It can be a hard thing to turn off because it involves giving up control, allowing myself to be potentially caught off guard, embarrassed, and hurt. At the same time though, I do wonder: if I can map out everything we’re going to say, what’s the point of talking? 

When I was writing the part about the bullies, it made me laugh that they probably didn’t even realize I came to them armed to the teeth while they likely hadn’t even given a minute of thought to me. The impact we have on each other’s lives can be hilariously disproportionate sometimes, so be careful with how you treat others. Also, fuck middle school.

This example was dark, and frankly, I don’t know if it was the right example to start with. I do think I’ve cheered up quite a bit since middle school, which I’d call the lowest point, and I don’t think this kind of venomous intensity is how I think, at least anymore. But I do think this is where I started to learn to practice in my mind and also an example that would grab attention since it addressed a pretty influential period in my life, though not in spectacular depth.

And I really did practice all the examples I gave above — being funny, charismatic, smooth on a date, good at interviews, sympathy. Some choice stories I wanted to include but couldn’t fit into the narrative: memorizing every single explanation, joke, intonation, and facial expression for my section leading interview (which I got first try as a freshman), thinking of a dozen conversation starters for a date and how each would pan out, what “insightful” questions I could ask as follow-ups, learning to be jocular by thinking of what a very charismatic fencing friend of mine would do. I really think practicing this stuff in your head helps a lot, as funny, nerdy, or creepy as it sounds.

There’s also something to be said about how things can go quite differently from how you expected. Those are really the moments in which you learn the most about yourself, your biases, and specifically, where you’re wrong. In other words, you really learn a lot about how you should change your mental worldview by comparing what you think would happen and what actually does happen.

Thank you for reading, and I hope this week’s post was a bit more entertaining and interesting than the last. I, at least, enjoyed writing this much more.
