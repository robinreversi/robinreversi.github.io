As a kid, I always believed, secretly, that I could control the wind.

I believed that with twirls of the hands, flicks of the wrist, smooth, undulating movements of the arm, I could conjure the wind to appear and disappear, to rise and dwindle, sometimes even roar and whimper — but those were harder for me. 

I was speaker for the wind, master of the breeze, orchestrator of the tempest. 

I’d tell the wind to blow a little harder on sunny days, and it would, sometimes. 

I’d tell the wind to quiet down and shut up, and it would, sometimes. 

Sometimes the wind would be ever so petulant, disobeying every command, and I’d have to let it gust and roar as it pleased. Other days, the wind would lack energy, and I’d have to wait until it picked up again, teaching me a lesson in humility. 

In short, I had no superpowers other than an overactive imagination and the ability to mistake correlation and causation. And school quickly taught me that wind is just the movement of air from a high pressure area to a low pressure area, nothing else. 

There was no magic.

Middle school taught me that in a lot of ways.

I learned what it’s like to have to clean up someone else’s piss every time you wanted to use the restroom, what the word “fuck” looks like on a bathroom wall, and what shit looks like when it’s been sitting in a toilet for too long.

I learned what it’s like to get in line early, eager to snag a decent lunch for once, a rarity in public school cafeterias, only to be pushed further and further back as people cut in line shamelessly, walking up to friends, arms outreached, pulling them into safety, and how teachers would pass by and say nothing, jack shit, leaving you with food you would barely call food, disgusting slops of soggy chicken sandwiches that leaked preservatives and left you hungry, angry, and frustrated.

I learned what it’s like to go to someone for help and then to be told there's nothing they can do, that despite all the power they had, they would not do anything. 

Or worse, that they didn’t see the problem, that they didn’t think it was a big deal, to pick your fights.

I learned what it’s like to eat alone at lunch day after day because, the last time you tried to make friends, you were rebuffed for being too sincere, too honest, too open, and no one was interested in that. No one was interested in _you_.

I learned what it’s like to want to be alone and at the same time want friends, that odd place where companionship is suffocating, but isolation is tormenting. 

I learned what it’s like to be made fun of for being less masculine, more feminine, for being short, for apparently having a small penis, for clearly having squinty eyes, for being too smart, a suck up. 

I learned what it’s like to be hurt by words and how to barb my own, what it’s like to measure six inches and wishing, as a kid, to have a bigger dick, a wider chest.

I learned what it’s like to look in a mirror and wonder whether you’ll ever find yourself attractive, what it's like to start thinking of all the ways you could make up for your lack of looks, how you could be funny, nice, and smart. But you could never be good looking, at least, not in the way you saw other people who were good looking, white and tall and masculine. 

I learned what it’s like to be punished after you’ve tried your best, to be yelled at for dropping below a 95, as if everything you had to do was always so easy.

I learned what it’s like to go to class and feel hopeless because you can’t learn, because people are talking constantly, gossiping, laughing about this and that, not even bothering to whisper because they know the teacher doesn’t care so long as they don’t cause any real trouble.

I learned how mad people get when you ask them to stop talking.

I learned how the same people will then ask you for help, and that if you say no, they’ll find a different way to cheat.

I learned that teachers were okay with cheating, and principals were okay with bullying, and how people could believe completely ridiculous things about themselves, like “I’m a good teacher.”

Or, “I’m a good person.”

I learned what it’s like to be hurt and denied help, what it’s like to be lonely, day in, day out, what it’s like to feel hopeless, to feel angry and, at the same time, cold and numb.  

I learned a lot from middle school.

I learned I could not control the wind, that wind is just the movement of air from a high pressure area to a low pressure area, nothing else.

— 

David Foster Wallace said that wanting to commit suicide is like being trapped in a burning building. It’s not that you want to jump. It’s that you don’t see another choice.

I didn’t want to jump. But towards the end of 7th grade, I didn’t see another choice.

I’d see cars pass by, or the bathtub in my bathroom, or the balcony of a tall building, and they had new meaning.

I started seeing a therapist.

I wish I could say it helped.

It didn’t.

I went three times, and each time the therapist bought me a vanilla bean Frappuccino from Starbucks, in the eyes of a broken thirteen year old kid, an incredible gesture of kindness.

And each time we'd talk about my problems —  school, my dad, fencing, everything — and I’d cry no matter how good I thought I was feeling coming in.

But what good did it do me, what good did crying and vanilla bean Frappuccinos do me, when I had to return to the same living hell day after day?

So eventually I stopped going.

Sometime before, my sister introduced me to manga.

I think it was Skip Beat, a rom-dram about a girl who wants to be an actress but is caught between two exorbitantly powerful, handsome, tall love interests, also actors.

Not my taste, and the translations were hard to follow, but I started to read others — Naruto, One Piece, Bleach, Inuyasha, Zatch Bell, Death Note, Eyeshield 21, Prince of Tennis, Hajime no Ippo, Fullmetal Alchemist, Beauty Pop, The Breaker, I am a Hero, 20th Century Boys, Annarasumanara, Bakuman, Beck, Berserk, Billy Bat, Rurouni Kenshin, Slam Dunk, Magician, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, Special A, Fruits Basket.

I was enamored. 

How can I explain what manga did for me?

There was so much world-building, so much creativity.

I loved the way the power systems worked, how each mangaka built their character’s abilities a little differently, but no matter how their powers were constructed, you’d still feel a thrill when the main character got another badass power-up — so cheap, so dumb, so fun.

I loved the drama, how simple events turned into mind-blowingly complicated interpersonal affairs that could have been resolved with the tiniest bit of maturity, and it was fun to laugh at the stupidity, secretly envying the intensity. 

I loved the ingenuity of the storylines, how weekly updates could still unfold into something grand and masterful, the ah-ha moments when subtle actions fifty chapters ago became important, an incredible display of presence of mind or maybe just total bullshit.

But more than anything, I loved the naivety. I loved the simplicity. I loved the sincerity.

I loved the underdog who beat all odds, defied expectations, insisted the impossible was possible, never compromising what they believed in, who, no matter how hard things got, kept going with a smile. 

I loved the way friendships always won out in the end, the way friendships said differences and distance didn’t matter, that friendship was something more fundamental, that you could fight with someone, be incredibly different from someone, be apart from someone, but still be great friends, unlikely allies, incredible rivals.

I loved the hope and optimism, the idealism. 

Because that was everything I ever wanted.

How can I explain what manga did for me? 

It showed me a different way out. It screamed at me that life could be different. 

That maybe wind could be more than just the movement of air.

# Reflection

This blog post turned out unbelievably different from what I expected. 

I didn’t intend to write a two part piece, for one, and two, I didn’t intend to be so emotional. This was actually supposed to be a pretty analytical piece, designed to make a point. 

But I guess the emotional intensity of writing about middle school took over, and I had a choice. Do I contort what I had written to say what I wanted or do I just to let the thing speak?

I decided to just let the thing speak, and it’s really weird, as a creator, to see something take on a life of its own, become something totally different from what you intended, but I think it worked well. I hate stories that don’t flow, stories that go too haphazardly from one idea to the next, trying to make everything appear connected for the sake of the big conclusion, as if the rest of the story doesn’t matter. It was a step in reducing my ego, and a step towards allowing things to do what they wanted to do. Very interesting.

Middle school was really the hardest time for me, as a kid, and I had no idea what to do a lot of nights. For rhetorical choices, I didn’t mention a lot of the grittier details, and I think that was the right choice. This isn’t a piece about depression, not exactly. Maybe another time I’ll try and describe those feelings. 

But I cried while writing this, which I think, is a first for a blog post, another interesting thing.

I also find it funny how everyone I meet thinks I relate to the moody angsty character, but I definitely prefer the Narutos to the Sasukes of the genre. Also glad I got a chance to explain why I like and liked manga so much. I think it really was this instrumental in my life, funnily enough. Also surprising that despite the joy and optimism in a lot of these works, hospitalization from overwork is common in most mangakas, and I’m so grateful and so amazed these people do the work that they do. 

On the two part piece, I was against doing anything like this at the start of blog. I wanted to express a complete idea or story in each post. But after last week’s, I decided the quality was too poor, and that I couldn’t allow anything like that to happen again. So yeah, two parts. 

The next part will close and hopefully get around to saying what I originally wanted to say.

Thanks for reading!
