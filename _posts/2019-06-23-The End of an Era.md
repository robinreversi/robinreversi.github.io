Imagine falling backward, another person standing by to catch you. The first few times you’re unsure, and the process is more terror and uncertainty than anything else, so you stick your arms out as you tip over ever-so-slightly backwards. They catch you, of course, and maybe you laugh about how little you trust each other. So the next time, you decide to fall a little bit faster, seeing if they’ll catch you. And they do. So you fall even faster. And they catch you. 

You realize soon that this is pretty fun, so you start falling even faster. By the tenth time, you’re addicted to the head rush. By the hundredth, you can fold your arms across your chest. By the thousandth, the trust is so strong falling is no longer even exhilarating. It’s actually quite comforting. It’s like seeing the sun rise every morning or passing by a familiar landmark on your way home. It’s just a fact of the matter that you will be caught, a truth of life, a certainty.

That to me is what falling in love is like. It’s scary, then a head rush, then quite comforting, and, at its best, that was what my relationship with X felt like. It felt like no matter how fast the world spun or what obstacles tripped and knocked me over, she’d be there to catch me, and I too for her. And like many things we take to be true, you start to build your life assuming it will always be true, that this person will always be there to catch you when you fall.

All my life, I had always been somebody fantastic, someone who stood out and above the rest, who did the unbelievable, who really, really excelled.

But at a place like Stanford, the kind of person I wanted to be was an impossibility. Over your left shoulder is a gold medal winner at any of the International Olympiads, and over you right a serial entrepreneur who’s in Fortune's Twenty Under Twenty, and in front and behind, people who’ve done everything from solving cancer to displaying their own work at art museums to serious, real non-profit work. 

I had only fenced, and I’d gotten in through an athletic admission to a college that, frankly, didn’t even prioritize fencing. Against the brilliance of the people around me, I felt incredibly dim. 

But, whatever I felt, I also couldn’t give up my old identity. Success and centerstage were such fundamental parts of who I was, how could I? To rip them out, I, as I knew myself, would have to die.

So at one point, fall quarter, I tell my mom: 

“By the end of the first year here, I want to be on the same playing field as all the kids who did math and CS in high school. By the end of the second year, I want to be clearly better than them, and by the end of the third year, I want to be out in the field, doing important projects. I don’t know what I’m going to do senior year.”

And to that end, I worked hard. Freshman year, there were nights my arms would break out into rashes from the stress, nights I almost vomited when I saw my pencil, my body so overworked and unwilling to work, nights the joints in my fingers would ache from typing, nights I’d yell at my friends, nights I’d yell at myself, nights I’d cry, nights I wouldn’t cry because I had work to do, nights I’d cry anyway. 

I endured to show I was still somebody incredible. 

******

Sophomore year, X and I start fighting a lot. 

Trivial things in hindsight that a more mature couple may have handled better, but it was my first love and her first serious one too. 

I almost call things off winter break, tired of being emotionally wrung out day after day, of spending three exhausting hours working through our problems, but for reasons I can’t remember, we stay together. 

Maybe we just knew that despite all the friction and fighting, all the silence and shouting, the heart-wrenching violence we committed against each other would not even compare to the heart-breaking sadness we’d feel if we became exes.

Winter quarter, I worry for our relationship but surprisingly find a lovely, delightful, happy peace. 

It’s like old times again, and I remember telling her, in retrospect tempting fate and her anger, “Aren’t you glad we’re not fighting anymore?”

******

Sophomore fall, at the advice of one PhD student who ran a lab I badly wanted to join, I take three heavy technical CS classes, and I come out, weary and exhausted. 

I had needed so much help that I doubted whether I really had the chops to stay in the area. 

Frankly, I just felt so dumb so often. 

Things that would come to my friends within minutes would take me hours to get, and it felt like I was running the wrong race.

At the same time, I knew few others who’d done what I did, and I could see, in some ways, I was catching up. I had struggled, but it was still possible for me to be among the best, to be someone spectacular.

I contact the PhD student and ask him if I can join the lab.

He agrees to give me an interview, and I pace alone in my room the night before, memorizing my presentation, word for word.

I see another Asian CS guy come out of the interview room, and I can’t help but wonder whether I’m any different, how people would ever distinguish me from him if I’m not someone spectacular, and I go in.

A few days later, I find out I’m accepted, and I’m scheduled to work spring and summer. 

******

I remember waking up to leave for a competition, seeing her body next to mine, feeling her warmth, and then suddenly feeling an overwhelming desire to stay, to say fuck it and not go.

But I go anyway, step out and walk into the cold, cursing what I had to do, bags dragging behind me.

Surprisingly, I do well — it’d been my best performance in some years, and I was ecstatic.

When I come back to tell her how I did though, I'm met with apathy, disinterest.

Like a kid who’d just won a prize, I just wanted to share my accomplishment, especially with someone I loved.

Instead, she was checking her phone. 

I get upset and ask her to pay attention to me, to show some more interest, and she gets upset, because she feels like she is. And suddenly, we’re at war again. 

Turns out, it’d been a rough week for her. She’d been taking some of the hardest CS classes, and she was pre-occupied in dealing with her own stress. I had come in, happy, but unsupportive, inattentive to her needs.

So we try and make up. I apologize, she apologizes, but whatever fragile trust had been building had already broken again, and it was no longer possible to see each other the same way. 

Unsure of what to do anymore, we fought, and fought, and fought, and surprisingly, each time it hurt more and more and more as we hurtled towards the inevitable.

Start of spring quarter, we break up. 

I call my mom immediately, and cry, the kind of cry that hurts to cry, the shameful kind, the kind you don’t show anyone else, the kind that leaves you gasping for air but is somehow still so loud, the kind that makes your chest heave and your back shake, the kind that makes you seem ridiculous, snot dripping down your nose, the kind that shows you don’t know what to do anymore, that you’re broken inside, the kind that begs for help. 

It’s only the afternoon, so I surround myself with friends, move, keep moving, but then it’s night, and everyone goes to bed, and I have to stop moving.

I crawl into bed, too tired to sob anymore, and, as I lay down to sleep, I realize I miss her warmth. 

I miss her heat being next to mine.

I miss it so much I can't sleep. 

So instead I fold my arm over my eyes and replay our history, trying to understand where and why things went wrong, and, most importantly, if there was anything I could do to change what had just happened, and I cry again.

They demand forty plus hours a week, screen your resume and transcript, and then interview you before you’re accepted. The professor was one of the biggest names in the industry, and the number of applicants, I was told, was in the dozens. 

I felt like I had made it, like there could be no better proving ground, no better opportunity to rise up. 

I’m assigned to work on diagnosing injuries to the cervical spine, and there I meet my team lead, J, who, I’ll admit, I hated for a long time.

I thought she was brutal, demanding, and unfriendly. Her most common responses were “What’s blocking you?” and “Yes, but…” — her ways of saying “Why haven’t you finished this yet?” and “What you said doesn’t make any sense.”

I hated her because I was scared of her, felt bullied by her, but I didn’t work as hard as I did just to be intimidated into uselessness by one person. 

Failures were chased by effort, and I quickly learned to come prepared in every exchange, mapping out all the flaws in advance, staying ready to present her with a myriad of solutions that only she could decide as team leader. I learned to tell when she’s in a good mood or a bad mood, when to approach and when to stay the fuck away. I learned to take initiative before she does, to take on work before she asks me to. 

In other words, she taught me to be truly efficient, and, in hindsight, I’m grateful for her exacting, efficient management. 

By the end of spring, we’re one of the few teams with something to show, even if it wasn’t exactly paper-worthy. Though I doubted the benefits of our research, and I doubted whether I knew anymore about machine learning, I doubted myself less. I knew I could work, I knew I could work a lot, and I knew I could work at a high-performing level.

******

I do the dumbest thing possible and get on as many dating apps as possible. 

Flick flick flick. 

I try to fill that void, but I’m neither attractive enough nor social enough to do so via hook-ups. 

Flick flick flick. 

I start talking to a lot of girls, random people I knew once before, for obvious, pathetic reasons.

Flick flick flick.

I still ask X to lunch, every few weeks or so, and we’d get meals, always accompanied by tense, nervous laughter, my mind spinning as I try and find ways to smooth out the conversation. 

Two years of trust had made me addicted, dependent, and I was too weak to cut myself off, even as I saw her hanging out with other guys.

I hated myself for that, and one particularly bad day, the type where you’re so fragile you might just burst into tears, we had our weekly lab meeting. 

We’re going around, sharing what we did the past weekend, golf, Netflix, work, and when it’s my turn, I announce, “I broke up with my ex recently,” and sit down. 

The group’s quiet until the next person goes, and I wonder whether anyone would talk to me after and what they’d think of me.

Unexpectedly, however, I’m met with kindness. I find a vulnerable grad student, T, and ask him, constantly, what he thinks about love, whether I should get back with my ex, his own experiences. I badger him so much I even convince him, briefly, that he needs to go out and find love. 

A very patient guy, he listens more than he has to, and I find a friend.

******

Summer rolls in, and, for reasons I’ll describe some other time, I am very determined to minimize the work I do for the lab. 

Of course, I end up doing more research for the lab than I want, but it turns out well. Thanks to the directions my partner and I pursued, the project improves drastically, and makes it to a reasonably publishable state by the end of the quarter. We’re met with praise from the faculty, and I'm quite proud. With little to no supervision, we made good choices and produced good results. 

But more importantly than that, I join a paper reading group lead by C, the de facto head of another project.  

Within the lab, we often joked about how, if we could buy stocks in a person, we’d buy stocks in C. He was the 10x engineer, the one who did way more than you’d ever think possible, and he did it all the time. Though he was naturally sharp, what we admired most in C was probably his work ethic. I once heard he placed his desktop next to his bed so that every morning, he could just roll out of the covers and into his chair to start working. He told me he read a paper every night before going to bed, a sort of brainless, “cool down” activity for him. He studied math in undergrad just to show he could do it, that nothing was beyond him, and he was the person everyone went to for help, be it debugging complex deep learning models in PyTorch, finding errors in finicky system calls, or picking the right approach to a problem. 

C was, in other words, somebody extraordinary, and in some ways, everything I wanted to be professionally. 

So I worked hard that summer to earn his respect, reading every required paper each week when few others did, and I learned a lot from him. If J was my mentor, then C was my idol, and I tried to copy bits and pieces of his decisiveness, his discipline, his self-belief, the parts that, in my mind, made him so incredible. By the end, I’d read over a few dozen papers, and I knew I could do as much or more than some PhDs, at least among those I knew. 

******

I try harder to stay away. 

She tells me, in the last lunch of spring quarter:

“I never ask you out to lunch because I know you’ll ask me out eventually.”

And I swear I’d never contact her first again.

So instead, I spend a lot of time with T, and T teaches me how to enjoy being a young adult. He shows me to restaurants, tours me around SF, pushes me into my first taste of alcohol, convinces me to buy tickets to musicals and museums, and persuades me to take two hour coffee breaks during work, pausing to chat about life, love, and the future.

I see him, in some ways, as an older brother by the end of the summer, and as a key reason why I was able to stay away from X.

By the end of the summer, I can go a few days without thinking about X. I go on dates with other people. I find time to dance in the studios at night. I felt happy again, and the gap, it seemed, was closing.

I get a text at the end of August. 

“Hey, would you like to get boba sometime?” 

And suddenly, I’m a wreck as I remember both how I happy I was with her and how much she hurt me. 

It takes me a few hours to compose myself, but I ask T what I should do, and he advises me against it. 

I ask my mom what I should do, and she advises me against it.

So I respond, “Hey, sorry, I don’t think so,” knowing that, in doing so, I would probably never have a chance to be with her again.

******

Junior year, I feel ready and ambitious. 

Winter quarter, two graduate level A.I classes, college physics, and two labs. It was the most work I had ever planned, and I was determined to see it through because I had set two goals the previous spring — to win a class project award and to publish a paper — and I thought that if I could achieve these things all while juggling an intense class load, it would only add to the feat, only build on the mythos. 

I was obsessed, in other words, with being larger-than-life, with being fantastic, with doing and being the impossible, and I saw this quarter as a test of whether it was possible for me. As a result, I was exhausted and stressed most of the time, working seventy to eighty hours a week, and still very, very insecure. 

Just as before, I still felt like the constant laggard. I’d watch as friends instantly solved problems I’d spent hours struggling to understand, and I couldn’t help but wonder, often, whether I really was special or just another person who couldn’t accept they were only slightly better than average. 

But unlike before, I had also gotten better at managing my health. The symptoms I experienced freshman year didn’t appear again. My arms wouldn't break out into rashes from the stress. I never felt like vomiting. I knew to take care of myself to give my hands a rest. I was distant, but hopefully not too cold to my friends, and I treated my own failures more gently. 

And unlike before, I’d also gotten better at managing my time from working under J, and I had all the skills I needed to succeed from C. 

Combine this with my unhealthy attachment to success, and is it any wonder that I accomplished both my goals?

Working with a freshman year friend, our project earns second best paper in the class, garnering 280 likes on Twitter and 40 retweets, and the research I submit to CVPR, though only a workshop paper, is accepted.

And success felt exactly like I thought it would.

I felt so validated, like everything I had worked towards for the last three years had come to fruition, like my efforts hadn’t gone to waste. And though my insecurities still remain —  I still don’t think I’m excellent at math or CS — they're supplanted now by a newfound confidence that if I really want to do something, I can.

And that’s truly a fantastic feeling. 

******

Junior year, I start seeing Y.

I’m not madly in love with her, and she’s not enamored with me, but we’re interested enough to start a relationship. 

I try to fall for her, to lean back and allow her to catch me, to build trust. I share stories from my personal life, things I’d only told family and X before. I talk about my day, the stresses I felt, the accomplishments I made, the thoughts I’d had. 

But instead of warmth, I feel a cold, indifferent politeness from her, the kind of sympathy I might get from an acquaintance I’d barely talked to before, and it's unbearable.

We try to talk through it, but I don't feel hopeful, and eventually I stopped sharing. Eventually, she starts complaining I’m tired all the time, which was true, especially winter quarter, and predictably, we break up.

And though I’m not proud to say it, I felt relieved. 

I so missed being able to hang out with friends late at night, missed being able to watch the movies I wanted or eat at the places that I liked, missed being able to sleep in or wake up early, missed having all the blanket, all the bed. I missed being able to do what I wanted when I wanted, missed having control over my life, missed having my own space, physically and mentally. 

And more than everything, I missed being able to be all the parts that were me. I had spent so much energy caring for and attending to another person, both with X and with Y, and so many times I had felt suffocated. I couldn’t be too extroverted with X, or she’d be uncomfortable. I couldn’t be too introverted with Y, or she’d get bored. I couldn’t be too judgmental around X, or she’d be upset. I couldn’t be too critical around Y, or she’d get hurt. 

I couldn’t be, I couldn’t be, I couldn’t be.

So when we broke up, I felt relieved. I didn’t need to accommodate anyone else anymore. I could be without dependence. 

******

It’s not often I feel satisfied, but for once I do, and after that long winter, I’m ready to put my feet up and enjoy the sun.

I had accomplished my goals.

I was happy being single. 

I couldn’t ask for more. 

Junior year, spring quarter passes by easily. 

Like a deep breath of crisp fresh air, life feels sharp and vivid.

### Fin

I hope you can understand now why I called this The End of an Era.

Because, in reminiscing about the people who’ve changed my life in the last three years, and all that’s happened, I can’t help but feel like I’m at the end of something big. 

The two main narratives that’ve dominated my life — love and self-worth — feel like they’ve come to a proper close. 

I’m no longer obsessed with love; I don’t seek to build my entire world around any one person anymore.

I’m no longer plagued by self-doubt and insecurities; I don't feel so deeply inadequate compared to the people around me. 

And the people who’ve played key roles in my growth and development at Stanford are all leaving — C, J, and T — or my relationships with them have fundamentally changed — X and Y.

It’s the end of an era for me, and I think, now, I’m at the crossroads of something big.

Do I aim higher? 

Do I settle?

Where do I go from here?

What do I do about love, really?

I feel like I’m at the end of the rising action, and I'm about to start the main storyline. 

# Reflection 

After writing this, I’m convinced of two things — every work of non-fiction is fiction, and the difficulty of writing something scales exponentially with the thing’s length. The second point needs no explanation, but honestly reading over this, there are some many things that I omitted, so many insightful stories, that in some ways, this is the most barebones sketch I could have given you over the past three years.

There’s a lot of things I also wish I had done better — I don’t think I captured quite how stressed or how badly I wanted to be something great, I think I could have tied Y into the story more, the characters didn’t come alive as much I wanted in the story, and I think I could have introduced X better, or explained how we fell for each other more. At the same time, each of these small sections could have been fleshed out into its own blog post, so I’m going to be happy with how I did.

All in all, it was a fun piece to write. A lot of design choices, whether to weave the stories together or keep them separate, what stories to choose, present versus past tense, etc. 

And a really important one. I looked a lot at my diary to try and recapture the experiences I had, but I found so many holes, and I regretted not writing what I was feeling more often. This really does feel like the end of a chapter in my life, and I want to remember that, even years later.

There’s also some people who are leaving who didn’t make it into the narrative but also impacted my views a lot, namely one S, who I’m sure people familiar with me will be able to guess. He didn’t factor quite into the narrative because fencing hasn’t been a huge part of my life, at least not in college. But he was one of the people who convinced me you can do big things if you really, really want to.

On that note, I only vaguely tried to preserve anonymity. If anyone would like for me to redact or edit this post, I’d be happy to.

Lastly, sorry for being late. I procrastinated too much, and I certainly could have made it on time this week. As I settle into work at Amazon, hopefully I’ll also settle into a better routine.
