I wanted to write something wilder, more fun, that’d let me play more and structure less. 

So here’s the first stream of consciousness style post I guess I’ve ever done.

And immediately, I’ve lost my own attention.

it’s unclear what the subject will be, why it’s relevant to anyone, and 

But I just have one goal 

It’s something I realized while writing 

The bond between reader and writer is not that strong

I, for one, am a terrible reader

I demand everything to be interesting. 

Every sentence should be interesting.

Boring ideas and cliches

nope

I autocomplete those 

and I need to wait for the writer

to catch up 

Fucking finally

I hate when I can guess the 

Like

“Oh, really? You chose that ending?”

I don’t know how to stop.

But here’s something I thought

What if I wrote 

that took 100% 

because 

I mean Korean is like that

Supposedly 

the ends of sentences are left

because the context is 

No space

The thought completes itself

Texting too 

Say four words in a text to a friend 

You don’t need

The words complete

Or even if it doesn’t, you get the gist

The feeling

The meaning

Miscommunication is critically possible here

because it creates possibility for you

Enumeration, on the other hand,

is holding your head down

and forcing you to see what I see

You are not allowed to go at your own pace

to give your own meaning

Endless worlds collapse in that way

I wanted in this piece

to run with my reader

to be in sync with my

or even one step ahead

Because it’s a rare feeling

to feel surprised by what you’re reading

to feel outpaced

to sprint while


# Reflection

You might be thinking, oh wow, this is not that clever; anyone can write fast, make line breaks, and remove punctuation.

But you probably felt it a little bit there in that last sentence when I enumerated three things. A familiar rhythm. An expectation.

Predictability.

One of the things I’ve struggled the most with, in recent posts, has been how predictable everything has felt.

Structure, content, tone — everything. 

I know my childhood trauma.

And yet, somehow, I feel like you know it too, really.

What can I say about how bad childhood was? How much can I say?

It was bad, then good.

Maybe I just lack the words.

But what I can say is that it didn’t really interest me anymore, and, in the absence of interest, I aimed for completeness, for clarity, for impact. 

I aimed to record but didn’t know why it was interesting. 

A painful and obvious mistake.

This was a much more fun piece to write.

And interesting to edit.

And interesting to me.

I’m curious whether I’ll understand anything I’ve written here later, or whether anyone will understand any of it anyways.

Thanks for reading!
