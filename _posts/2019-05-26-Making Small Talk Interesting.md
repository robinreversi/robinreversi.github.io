title: Making Small Talk Interesting

I thought I’d start with this piece because I think most people find me a fun or at least interesting person to talk to. I’ve also been asked before how I seem to be able to make good conversation fairly consistently, and so I thought I’d share my thoughts.

To the point: how do you make interesting conversation?

Actually, I feel like the wording is slightly off here. It might just be me, but the question feels like it suggests there are interesting conversations, boring ones, and a clear separation in between, and that puts too much pressure on starting well. Like if you don’t start well, the conversation is fucked. But most conversations don’t start interesting. They start small, and if you’re good at making conversation, end up much richer. 

So, I think the right question to ask then, as small as the difference might be, is: how do you make a conversation interesting? 

I think it’s knowing how to transition. People will complain about the number of shallow conversations they have that lack substance and how they wish they could cut these out of their day. 

Examples (credits to Vince Ranganathan and Robel Daniel for helping find these):

- “Where are you living next year?” 

- “What are you doing over the summer?” 

- “What’s your major?”

- “Do you like that class?”

But I think it’s very possible and frankly not even too hard to answer these questions and turn the conversation into something more interesting. From my very limited experience but somewhat consistent success, transitioning from small talk to interesting conversation requires three things:

1. Telling a little more than what’s appropriate.
2. Asking questions you genuinely want to know the answers to. 
3. Asking questions that they want to answer.

Having written these, it feels painfully obvious, like maybe I was the only one who didn’t get basic human interaction. After all, breaking the ice requires toeing the line. And why would you ever ask questions you’re not interested in, or ask a question someone doesn’t want to answer? On reflection though, I think we don’t really do these things that often or we don’t do them intentionally. For example, I know when someone asks me “Where am I living next year?”, the dialogue often goes like this:

C1:

- Me: “Oh I’m in X dorm, where are you living?”

- Them: “Haha that’s great, I’m in Z dorm!"

- Me: “Oh nice, are you excited about it?”

- Them: “Yeah, …”

And at that point I usually lose interest and tune out. I didn’t tell them anything substantial, I didn’t ask anything I really wanted to know, and usually they don’t really want to tell me about how excited they are about their housing. It’s a lose-lose situation, and the conversation comes to an awkward halt most times shortly after. But here’s an easy alternative to imagine:

C2:

- Me: “Oh I’m in X dorm. I drew for a single because I realized I hate living with people haha, but where are you living?”

- Them: “Oh sorry to hear that, I’m in Z dorm.”

- Me: “Oh nice, you draw with anyone?”

- Them: “Yeah, I drew with Y and W.”

- Me: “How’re your relationships with them?”

- Them: “Oh haha, Y and W…”

The differences from the previous faux conversation are obvious in some ways and much more subtle in others, but I think the most important differences are these. The first is that I said something the other person could react to if they chose and that might lead into a more interesting conversation about why I hate living with people. The second but arguably more useful difference is that I asked a question I wanted to know the answer to. As someone interested in gossip and human relationships, I’m generally interested in how people get along with their friends and acquaintances. “Did you draw with anyone?” on its own is incredibly boring, but I asked it because I knew I’d be able to lead the conversation into “How’re your relationships with them?” which is much more interesting to hear.

It’s important to note though that I didn’t immediately ask anything like “Oh are you romantically interested in Y or W?” or “Have Y or W done anything that have made you resent them?” Not only will you get a weak answer, but you’ll also likely be labeled as a stranger forcing their way to intimacy. Intimacy requires a warm up, and hopefully that's obvious to most, but there’s a certain class of people who err not on the side of caution as most do, but instead err aggressively, sometimes unknowingly, sometimes not. I’m guilty of this, having asked some questions people probably weren’t incredibly ready to answer. Thus, to help those people, here are two examples of generic conversations starters I’m sure friends will recognize and that allow people to say as much as they want (and I’ll update this list if I find more):

Examples:

- “Anything on your mind recently?”

- “Anything interesting happen lately?"

And that’s really it. If the examples seem contrived or helpful, it’s hopefully more my inability as a writer than a fault with the method. This is genuinely how I approach making a conversation interesting. I think it really is just about exposing yourself a little bit more at a time, asking what you’re interested in, and making sure your partner is comfortable. Likewise, if you want to end a conversation quickly, just tell people nothing about yourself, don’t ask questions, and be rude. 

I’ll end on one final thought. I think making a conversation interesting can, in some sense, be broken down in this way. But what most people don’t realize though, is how exhausting this process can be, emotionally and mentally. I think the reason I answer the way I do now as in sample conversation 1 isn’t so much because I lack the capacity to make interesting conversation but just because I don’t want to. It’s simply too much effort, and I think this happens a lot when your partner isn’t the most attentive or interested in you. There’s a tension then between asking what you want to ask and asking questions that they want to answer, of keeping your interest or theirs. It’s probably not the lack of ability but the lack of energy, enthusiasm, or will that really hampers us from expanding our conversations with acquaintances beyond pleasantries. 

So, what I’m wondering about lately isn’t how to make conversation interesting, but how to make conversation feel effortless because it certainly does happen. I’m just not sure right now how — whether it depends on the person, my mood, my life situation, etc.

# Reflection

This was harder than I thought and longer than I thought. But good. I had thought a bit about this topic before, and I thought I could write and express myself quickly. It was good to learn that expressing your ideas on paper is a lot like grinding down a sharp edge with sand paper — it requires a lot of elbow grease. 

I worry I haven’t expanded or contributed too much to this discussion. It all feels too obvious. But I also know it certainly wasn’t for me for a long time, and I did wonder for a while why we made so much small talk and why it seemed so difficult to move beyond those subjects. 

I also regret only addressing 1-on-1 conversations. I think group interactions are really interesting to think about too, especially with regards to how to voice your opinions, be heard, and manage attention. Maybe another post.

Staying positive and not being negative was hard. I am not the most optimistic person when it comes to people, and I found myself venting too much sometimes with unnecessary and unimportant criticisms.

On that note, I really did try hard to write simply and concisely, cutting away anything that didn’t serve a purpose. I’m putting together a doc of lines that didn’t make the cut but I liked. Maybe I’ll publish that some day.

Overall, I feel like this was a success. I think I was ably to clarify and solidify my thoughts and codify a few of my beliefs, however peripheral. Of course, feedback and especially opinions would be appreciated.

I’ll also try harder to release earlier on Sundays, ideally at 11am. Putting together the webpage, the about, and the intro took much longer than I thought.
