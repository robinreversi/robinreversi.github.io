Most of you are probably friends, and hopefully only a few of you are enemies, but to the point:

## Why am I writing a blog?

It just feels natural. Like if there were some overarching narrative of my life, this is the time where I should and would start a blog. I can't explain it more than that. I can rationalize it -- maybe -- as having to do with my age, or wanting to keep a record of my thoughts, or wanting to hear new ideas and broadcast my own. But honestly, none of these feel exactly right. They satisfy the logical, rational side of me, but not the part that wants to write. 

That part just says "the time is right." But maybe I'm just a romantic.

## What will you write about? 

What I think I've learned from the stories from my life, things I'm still trying to understand, and, for levity, maybe some day-to-day idle thoughts.

I've posted a schedule under the about section if you want concrete topics.

## Why "solo"? 

I'll be honest -- I think it sounds sexy. 

But more than that, I picked "solo" because you don't go to a solo performance to watch many different people perform. You go to watch one person. And that's what this blog is. It's a blog about me and my internal world, how I think, the beliefs and experiences that shape and shaped me, and the topics I'm still figuring out. It's a chance for me to occupy the centerstage of a person's mind, to really come alive in the way that I want to.

So why "solo"?

Because this is a solo performance. 

## Am I scared?

Yes and no. 

I'm not scared about putting my life or my opinions out on the internet. I'm still trying to decide whether I'm wise, stupid, or really stupid for believing this, but, I'm not scared because, in general, I believe if you approach something with honest, sincere intentions and good will and good faith effort, and are willing to change your mind and opinions, and reflect on your actions, people are usually forgiving for the mistakes you make. It's a kind of belief that we can understand each other beyond the observable, that we can trust, believe in, and prioritize good intentions despite obvious transgressions.

Maybe I'm beyond privileged to have had experiences that encourage me to believe this. But I do think that's the kind of world I'd like to be in, and believing in anything else would reduce me to a pessimistic cynic.

I am scared though that my writing will be uninteresting, unoriginal, or, maybe worst, poorly written. I have a lot of pride, and it's amazing how good something can sound in your head but how awfully it can read on the page. Still, I want to write, and I want to write well, so I will.
