What makes me extraordinary

isn’t what i’ve accomplished so far 

in my time at stanford

it’s all of the fights i had to win

that a lesser person 

would have lost

all the times 

i felt broken down to pieces

thinking 

how if i had a gun

i wouldn’t be alive

and how i picked myself up

from that place

again

and again

and again

why

i don’t know

but i survive



and i find new ways 

to be alive

to feel alive


i survive

and i push through

that’s what has made me 

extraordinary


# Reflection 

not a good time in my life honestly

so much going on 

sometimes i stop and can’t breathe

i need to get off my bike 

couldn’t cry

tried

but i couldn’t

broke down tonight

finally

watching a homeless man 

be reunited with his dog

i cried

and i was so glad

because i couldn’t cry

i couldn’t



will things be okay?

i don’t know


family breaking down, friends leaving, breaking apart

i don’t know


future is bleak

that’s what my friend said



i see it now

i don’t know


can i survive?


when i can’t even cry?


prayer, maybe
