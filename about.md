Who am I? That's a good question, and it's a hard one to answer. I can tell you where I'm from, what I'm interested in, or who I am in relation to other people -- Texas, A.I, philosophy, psychology, self-reflection, son, younger brother, older brother, family, friend, stranger.  

Or going a bit deeper, I can tell you how I think other people perceive me, how I perceive myself, or maybe even who I want to be. I've been described as funny, charismatic, thoughtful, kind, soft-hearted. I've been described as judgmental, mean, cold, intimidating, severe. I see all this in myself, and I am, at least I hope, self-aware to recognize when I'm being each. I see myself sometimes as a genius, if I'm being honest. But like with any big ego, and being at a place like Stanford, that never lasts very long. Most of the time I see myself as something between a very smart, overly ambitious kid who lately has been probably too mean to his friends and someone who's too harsh on himself, watching his moves like a guard watches their prisoner.

Who do I want to be?

Probably a little less broken, probably a little kinder. Maybe a little wilder. But more than anything, I want to be a person who can make others happy while taking care of myself. I think the world needs more people like that. 

So who am I then?

Like I said, it's a hard question to answer. It's a hard question to answer because I am large, and I contain multitudes (Whitman). No single action, testament, or self-statement is going to give you, my reader, that sense of who I am. 

So instead, I invite you to read this blog, to follow as I self-examine my own thoughts and beliefs, and maybe not only will you understand who I am, I might too.
